            <p>But beyond the algorithms and visualizations, what truly sets me apart is my commitment to bridging the gap between technical complexity and business value. I believe that the most impactful solutions arise when data insights are translated into a language that decision-makers can act upon. This philosophy has guided my work across diverse sectors, from retail and manufacturing to finance and research.</p>
