            <h2>Leading Telecom Deployments and Optimizing Security Operations</h2> 
            <p>As a Lead Engineer, I have overseen the installation and configuration of sophisticated networking and surveillance systems for various clients. Two notable projects from my portfolio include:</p> 
            <h3>Structured Cabling at Huduma Kiosk, Majengo, Nairobi</h3> 
            <p>I was responsible for the end-to-end structured cabling deployment at the Huduma Kiosk government service center in Majengo, Nairobi. This involvedInstalling over 30 drops, testing each cable run, patching and labelling. I then configured the switches, setting up VLANs, ACLs and other network segmentation best practices.</p> 
            <p>Testing was a critical part of my process to ensure cable performance and connectivity. Throughputs were verified to be within specifications. Documentation was provided, future-proofing expansion. Staff training prepared operations for smooth network management.</p> 
            <h3>CCTV Installation and Configuration at EPRA</h3> 
            <p>As lead for the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority surveillance system upgrade, I installed 40+ megapixel cameras with Dark Fiber connectivity across their compounds. The NVR was configured for retention policies and user permissions.</p> 
            <p>I conducted POE testing and tweaked camera angles for coverage needs through the installer app. System failover was tested by simulating power/network outages. Training on forensic search abilities and incident response empowered the security team. </p>
