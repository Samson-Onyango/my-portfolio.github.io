                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I utilized the powerful Monte Carlo Simulation technique in Excel to perform advanced business analytics, risk analysis, and profitability modeling. By simulating multiple scenarios and analyzing the probability distributions of potential outcomes, I provided valuable insights for data-driven decision-making across various industries and business cases.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Monte Carlo Simulation involves generating random numbers to simulate various scenarios based on predefined probability distributions. In Excel, I leveraged built-in random number generation functions and created custom formulas to model different business scenarios accurately.</p>
                    <p>By running thousands of iterations, I could analyze the range of possible outcomes, calculate their probabilities, and identify the most likely scenarios, risks, and potential profitability associated with each decision.</p>

                    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
                    <h3>Case 1: Revenue Modeling for a Professional Football Team</h3>
                    <p>I developed a spreadsheet model to analyze the ticket sales revenue distribution for a professional football team's home venue, Arrowhead Stadium. By simulating the demand for different seating zones based on normal distributions, the model provided a reliable estimate of the total revenue, enabling effective budgeting and decision-making. <br><a href="montecarlo.xlsx">Monte Carlo Simulation Model</a></p>
        
                    <h3>Case 2: Credit Card Profitability Analysis for J&G Bank</h3>
                    <p>For J&G Bank, I created a Monte Carlo Simulation model to evaluate the profitability of their credit card product. By incorporating various factors such as application volumes, approval rates, charges, fees, and maintenance costs, the model accurately predicted the probability of profitability under different scenarios, allowing the bank to make informed decisions regarding their credit card operations.<br><a href="montecarlo.xlsx">Monte Carlo Simulation Model</a></p>
