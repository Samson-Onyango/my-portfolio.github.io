				<h2>Overview/Introduction</h2>
				<p>This project aimed to explore how public libraries engage with their local communities in decision-making processes related to health programming and services. Engaging community members and stakeholders is crucial for libraries to better understand and address the specific health needs and priorities of the populations they serve. By combining quantitative and qualitative research methods, this study provided a comprehensive understanding of libraries' current practices and experiences in community engagement.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<p>A convergent mixed methods design was employed, collecting both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) data concurrently. The quantitative component involved an online survey administered to librarians across the country, gathering information on the frequency and nature of their libraries' engagement with community members and health providers in decision-making processes. The qualitative component consisted of in-depth interviews with a subset of librarians, allowing for a deeper exploration of their perspectives and experiences related to community engagement practices.</p>
				<p>For the quantitative analysis, SPSS software was used to conduct descriptive statistics, correlational analyses, and relevant inferential tests on the survey data. The qualitative data from the interviews were analyzed using Dedoose, a software for coding and thematic analysis of textual data.</p>

				<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
				<h3>Quantitative Analysis</h3>
				<p>The quantitative analysis involved the following processes:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>Develop a codebook</h4>
						<p>A codebook was created to assign codes and variable names to each survey item. The codebook also included the response options and their corresponding values. <br><a href="files/codebook.docx">Codebook</a></p>
						
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Data file creation and data entry</h4>
						<p>A new data file was created in SPSS, and variables were defined based on the codebook. The survey data was then entered into the corresponding columns in the SPSS data file. <br><a href="files/dataset.sav">Dataset</a></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Data cleaning</h4>
						<p>Frequencies for all variables were run to identify missing data and out-of-range values. Any necessary corrections were made to the dataset.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Analysis and Write-up</h4>
						<p>Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) were calculated for demographic variables and presented in a "Sample Description" table. Means, standard deviations, and correlations were calculated for the engagement variables and reported in a summary table. Relevant paragraphs were written to interpret and discuss the findings. <br><a href="files/SPSSOutput.spv">SPSS Analysis Output</a><br><a href="files/QuanWriteup.docx">Write-up for Quantitative Analysis </a> </p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>Qualitative Analysis</h3>
				<p>Using Dedoose, the interview transcripts were coded and analyzed for emerging themes. Several key themes were identified, including the importance of building trust and relationships with community members, the challenges of reaching and engaging diverse populations, and the need for dedicated resources and staff training to support community engagement efforts effectively.<br><a href="files/DedooseChartExport.xlsx">Dedoose Chart Export</a></p>

				<h2>Integration and Findings</h2>
				<p>The quantitative and qualitative findings were integrated to answer the mixed methods research questions. The survey results provided an overview of the frequency and patterns of community engagement practices among libraries, while the interview data offered deeper insights into the motivations, challenges, and strategies employed by librarians in their engagement efforts.<br><a href="files/mixed-method writeup.docx">Mixed-Methods Write-up</a></p>

				<h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
				<p>One of the key challenges encountered in this project was the recruitment of librarians for both the survey and interviews, as their schedules and availability can be limited. To overcome this, multiple recruitment strategies were employed, including outreach through professional networks and associations.</p>
				<p>Another challenge was the integration of the quantitative and qualitative data, as the survey and interview questions did not always align perfectly. However, this process highlighted the complementary nature of the two data sources and the value of using a mixed methods approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic.</p>
				<p>A valuable lesson learned from this project was the importance of clear communication and coordination between the research team members responsible for the quantitative and qualitative components. Regular check-ins and collaborative discussions facilitated a smoother integration process and ensured that the findings from both data sources were appropriately interpreted and synthesized.</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>This mixed methods project provided valuable insights into the current state of community engagement practices among public libraries in the context of health programming and services. By combining quantitative data on the frequency and patterns of engagement with qualitative insights into librarians' motivations, challenges, and strategies, the study highlighted the diverse approaches and experiences of libraries in involving community members and stakeholders in their decision-making processes.</p>
				<p>The findings underscore the need for continued efforts to support and enhance community engagement initiatives within public libraries, particularly those serving disadvantaged populations with unique health needs and barriers. Providing libraries with dedicated resources, training, and guidance on effective community engagement strategies can help them better serve their communities and contribute to improving health literacy and health outcomes.</p>
				<p>Future research could further explore the specific strategies and best practices for successful community engagement in libraries, as well as the long-term impacts of such initiatives on health outcomes and community well-being. Additionally, examining the perspectives of community members themselves could provide valuable insights into their experiences and preferences regarding engagement with public libraries.</p>
